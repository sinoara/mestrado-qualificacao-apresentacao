  abstract = "The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative
              account, deeply rooted in psychological and neuroscientific
              perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize
              their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning
              successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity,
              however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must
              derive efficient representations of the environment from
              high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past
              experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other
              animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious
              combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory
              processing systems, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural
              data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals
              emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference
              reinforcement learning algorithms. While reinforcement learning
              agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains,
              their applicability has previously been limited to domains in
              which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with
              fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent
              advances in training deep neural networks to develop a novel
              artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn
              successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs
              using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on
              the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games. We
              demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the
              pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the
              performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level
              comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a
              set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture
              and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between
              high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the
              first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a
              diverse array of challenging tasks.",
